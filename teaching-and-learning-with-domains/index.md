# Teaching and Learning with Domains

Now that you have these key building blocks for how the web works, building a digital identity, and creating a site, you are well equipped to integrate it into your teaching or your learning experience at SNC. There are various reasons you may want to see Knight Domains used in a course:

- Asking students to communicate using the web as their platform is a natural and effective way to raise the bar for [critical thinking and creative problem solving](https://www.snc.edu/oie/assessment/cwlo.html) in a project.
- Getting familiar with the tools that make the web work helps students [build digital skills](https://techbar.knight.domains/bryn-mawr-framework/) in a unique, exciting, and practical way.
- [Working on projects, creating e-portfolios, participating in learning communities, and publishing research](https://www.aacu.org/trending-topics/high-impact) is at its most impactful when students have the opportunity to do that work in the open.

Not only does working openly on the web make the work more accessible, but it challenges students to think critically about how they present themselves, their work, the audience for that work, and their roles as knowledge disseminators.

## Creating the structure for your course

The goals you have for the students taking your course will influence how you may want to set up the "digital infrastructure" of your course. It won't make sense for every project to require students to create their own account and website. Sometimes a mixture of community spaces and personal spaces are more appropriate. While there are limitless ways to set imagine this space on the web for a teacher and their students, we'll focus on two common ways to set things up:

### 1. Making a course site

If you like the idea of your student's writing in the open, perhaps via regular blogging or reflections, but you do not want to have students go create their own sites, you could make a single course site that you and your students both use.

The benefits to this approach are that your students do not have to create their own accounts and sites, and all of the writing related to your course happens in one place. The disadvantage here is that students likely won't engage with the public nature of their work in the same way; their name or identity isn't as closely tied to this site as it would be if it was their own.

When setting up a site like this there are a few different things we would recommend to make it successful:
- If you are using Moodle for your course, consider linking to the site from there. It's probably a good idea to include a link in your syllabus too.
- If you are planning to have students blog on this course site, add them as [Users in your site's Dashboard](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-new-users-and-authors-to-your-wordpress-blog/#manual) so they can log in and write posts.
- Take a moment in class to point out the log in page for your site as well as the Forgot password link so they can still get logged in if they forget their password. Consider adding a login link right to the homepage of the site so it is easy to find!

### 2. Students creating sites on their own accounts

On the other hand, you can have students make an account on Knight Domains and set up their own site. Maybe students will be making something that's not exactly a blog, you want them to have more control over the design of their site, or you would like them to explore making their space on the web, and your course may be a good time for them to get started!

While there are plenty of advantages to this approach, most of the disadvantages come down to the time it will take for students to come to grips with the tools they are using and what it means to build their digital identity.

Here are some recommendations to make this approach successful:
- Talk with your students about the concept of [Digital Identity](https://docs.reclaimed.tech/domains-camp-2?view=). You may want to consider having them do [Visitor / Resident mapping](https://docs.reclaimed.tech/domains-camp-2?view=#Visitors-and-Residents) and a [goal setting exercise](https://docs.reclaimed.tech/domains-camp-4#).
    - Have them consider if the course work they are doing belongs on their main site, or perhaps a different site installed in a [subdomain or subfolder](https://support.reclaimhosting.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404727287575-Subdomains-and-Subfolders#understanding-file-structures-0-1).
    - Make sure students have an idea of what they can do with their work after the course is over. They may want to choose to keep it, bring it with them when they graduate, archive it to a different URL, or delete it!
- Introduce students to resources that they have to help with them with Knight Domains and WordPress. They can check out the [Support Documentation](https://knight.domains/support/) and visit the [Tech Bar](https://techbar.knight.domains/) to get help.

## Writing for the web

Regardless of how you have your students writing on the web you will want to make sure they are thinking about how to best utilize the web as a medium. This resource from Coventry University covers some of the ways to make sure you are writing effectively for the web:

[Writing for the Web - Coventry.Domains DoOO Support](https://coventry.domains/learn/writing-for-the-web/)

Coventry also has an excellent guide on how to source media in an appropriate way for publishing on your site:

[Sourcing Media (the Right Way) - Coventry.Domains DoOO Support](https://coventry.domains/learn/sourcing-media/)

You can use some of the suggestions in the above resources, combined with your own requirements for your class, to create expectations that you can share with your students. Consider making your expectations a public page on your site and linking to them in your syllabus or Moodle!
