# Digital Identity and Ownership

As we've learned so far, there are numerous different ways to create and post content on the web, so why use Knight Domains and WordPress? It all comes down to how you want to shape your Digital Identity, and what control you have over the identity you create.

## Digital Identity

- Who are you online?
- What traces do you leave?
- How do you describe yourself to others?
- How do you shape your digital presence?

These are the central questions around Digital Identity. Identity is how you see yourself, but it is also affected by how others see you, what spaces you share, and what actions you take in those spaces.

### Visitors and Residents

[Visitors and Residents](https://daveowhite.com/vandr/) is one way to think about your relationship with the web. You can think of it as a spectrum of modes of online engagement:

In **Visitor** mode, you do not leave a social trace, and engagement with an online space is objective focused. You find a tool that will help you accomplish your goal, use the tool, then move on. In **Resident** mode, you engage on a social level with the web, leaving behind something about yourself. These are spaces that you use for self-expression.

Taking this further, [Visitor and Resident Mapping](https://daveowhite.com/vandr/vr-mapping/) can help you visualize your Digital Identity:

#### ðŸŽ¯ Visitor Resident Mapping

- On a sheet of paper or using [this digital template](https://jadin.me/make-map), make your own Visitor Resident Map. Give yourself a time limit of 5 minutes.
- After you've finished your map:
    - Are any of the quadrants of your map more filled than the others?
    - Are there tools that cross over any of the axis of your map?
    - Are there any quadrants in your map that are underrepresented, or that you wish you could build more of a presence in?

### Shaping your Digital Identity

Creating a website (or many sites) is a powerful way to build your web presence because you have control over how you represent yourself. There are many platforms that let you publish text or images, but a personal website allows you creative control over not only what you share, but how you share it. 

For building a personal website, we recommend using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). WordPress is an [open-source](https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/what-is-open-source/) tool that, by some measures, [powers 40% of the web](https://wordpress.org/40-percent-of-web/). Its popularity and open-source nature means that there are countless places you can host your site, allowing you the freedom to not be tied to any particular company's business model. Choosing to use open-source tools like WordPress allows you to build your space on the web in a way that's flexible, portable, and sustainable.

### A Domain of One's Own

Knight Domains is a [Domain of One's Own initiative](https://umw.domains/guides/domain-of-ones-own-overview/) that provides students, faculty, and staff the ability to sign up for a domain name and web hosting space. While there are many places you can host a WordPress site, Knight Domains gives you access to an entire web hosting account that allows you to create multiple sites and use a variety of different web applications while you [build on and explore the possibilities of the open web](https://youtu.be/PHLZFWGou_M). This space is also built with open-source tools, meaning that you have control over what you create, and can take it with you to host it someplace else when you need to.
