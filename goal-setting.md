# Goal Setting

Now that we know how URLs and structure work on the web, we can start to build our site with intention site with intention. When creating a site, it's possible to build the ship as you sail it, improvising what you want in the moment. However, by setting deliberate goals for your site, you shape your Digital Identity more easily, since you know what you're trying to accomplish and won't be aiming for a moving target. And be specific! You don't need to create one single site that can "do it all" -- you can always create another one, specialized to the job at hand (and maybe even dress it up to look like part of the same site after the fact).

## Considering Your Site's Purpose

Different websites do different work. Consider Facebook, Wikipedia, and The Onion: each one uses a different tone, offers users different tools, and lays out their content in a different way. Your personal site won't be the same as Facebook, Wikipedia or The Onion, and that's the point: they all serve as useful examples of how no two websites are alike, based on what they're trying to achieve.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Defining the Purpose of Your Website

Sit down with a piece of paper or a blank document, and take some time to think about what you want to accomplish with your site.

Use the sample questions to guide you, but you shouldn't feel limited by them. If you'd like more to go off of, Coventry Domains' [Define The Purpose of Your Website](https://coventry.domains/learn/define-the-purpose-of-your-website/) has more sample questions to use. Spend 10-15 minutes thinking through this.

- Do you want your site to be **public** or **private?**
- Do you want your site to be **personal** or **professional?**
-- Based on that, what sort of **content** do you plan on sharing (academic papers, personal blog posts, resumes/CVs, recipes, poetry...)?
- Do you want your site to be **static** (staying relatively fixed over time) or **dynamic** (updated or changed frequently or semi-regularly)?
- What **tone** do you want to use for your site (professional, formal, casual, humorous, etc.)?
- How do you want people to **interact** with your site? Do you want them to leave comments/contribute posts/etc.? Do you want them to view your work without adding to it?
- Think of sites you enjoy visiting or want to **emulate**. What about them do you admire? What do you think they do effectively?

Coventry Domains' [Imagining Your New Website](https://coventry.domains/learn/imagining-your-new-website/) also offers resources for planning your site using metaphors. In this exercise, you would think about planning your site like furnishing a house (what features do you need?), decorating a room (what furnishings do you want?), or cultivating a plant (how should this grow over time?). If you're having trouble with the above questions and would like a more holistic approach, you can use this as an alternative.

## Visitors and Residents Revisited

[The Digital Identity and Ownership unit](/identity-and-ownership) included [a section on **"Visitors and Residents"**](/identity-and-ownership#Visitors-and-Residents) about how sites engage with their users: focusing on objectives, or focusing on creation. **Visitor mode** means that users visit the site, achieve what they came to do, and move on, while **Resident mode** encourages users to contribute to the site and share their own work or content.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Visitor/Resident Mapping Your Site

With your goals as new context, return to the Visitor/Resident Map, again using paper or [this digital template](https://jadin.me/make-map). This time, think about how you chose to define your site, and then decide where on the map your site should lie.

## Intentional Design
Now that you've thought through what you want your site to accomplish, it's time to think through how it'll do that.

Returning to the three examples from earlier, Facebook, Wikipedia and The Onion, each site is designed differently in order to facilitate its goals. In **ðŸŽ¯ Defining the Purpose of Your Website**, you considered what you want your site to be, and thought of some other sites that you admired.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Domains, Paper, Scissors
This design activity was created by Coventry Domains to help users plan the look of their site without having to learn web design tools first.

To get started, print out [this free template](https://coventry.domains/archive/learn/wp-content/uploads/domain-paper-scissors-dmll.pdf) and cut out the panels on pages three and four. Then you can arrange the panels on the blank space on page two. Experiment with different layouts and see which ones you like. You can also mark up the panels or add color to visualize things more easily.

Each panel represents a specific type of page element, and has a small space where you can note down ideas for that page element. Page five explains what different page elements are, and pages five and six also answer some FAQ about getting started with blogging and WordPress.

If you're feeling lost or having trouble starting, try breaking down and analyzing other web pages to see how they lay things out. Page seven has an example of one site layout for you to look at. Alternatively, you could use one of the sites you looked at earlier during **ðŸŽ¯ Defining the Purpose of Your Website**.

## Instructor's Guide - Offering Example Goals
If folks are having difficulty defining what it is they'd like to do, try giving them an example goal set. This will let them practice these skills without getting sidetracked or frustrated trying to plan the "perfect" site.

A good example goal set would be to create a simple, professional landing page that also includes a web-native resume. If they decide they want to take the project further, you can suggest they also add a downloadable PDF resume and/or a contact form.
